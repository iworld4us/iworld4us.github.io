  <h2>Our apps do not collect or share personal information. Period.</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    We just don’t. We have nowhere to store it. We don’t even have a server database to store it.<br>
    So if someone asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn’t have anything to show them.<br>
    That’s why, with our apps, <span class="bold">what happens on your device stays on your device</span>.
